								During this week, Mr. Fitz showed us <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70267834">this</a> documentary. 
								He also lectured about some stuff but to be honest I wasn't really paying attention to anything he said. Here are 
								my notes from that: </br>
								- What is happening in the distribution of wealth (DOW)? Why? Is it a problem?</br>
								- A good way to compare the DOW is to compare the 1% to the workers at the middle</br>
								- After both bubbles in 1928 and 2007, spending increased but incomes did not. Caused debt bubble --> instability</br>
								- A strong middle class makes an economy stable. Middle class is the heart of consumer spending which is the heart of the economy. </br>
								- Middle class defined as 50% above and below the median income </br>
								- 1% starts at $380,000 (at the time of this documentary)</br>
								- Nick Hanauer is a douchebag. </br>
								- The rich spend too little of their income; not enough economic activity </br>
								- Investment in the middle class is directly funding job creation. The 1% don't create jobs, the middle class do. </br>
								- The GDP continues to increase but 'the gap' grows after the late 1970s. </br>
								- Technological innovation, manufacturing moved overseas, labor unions declining. </br>
								- globalization & technology </br>
								- globalization example: iPhone parts coming from EVERYWHERE (Japan, Germany, China, etc.) </br>
								- jobs --> overseas or to automation; undercut the old manufacturing jobs </br>
								- wages are stagnent but costs are increasing significantly over inflation (higher eduction, healthcare, housing, childcare) </br>
								- upward mobility is lacking due to the income gap. Ideal plan is to copy the American economy in 3 years following WW2 </br>
								- VIRTOUS CYCLE: productivity grows, wages increase,  workers buy more, companies hire more, tax revenues increase, gov. invests more, workers are better educated </br>
								- dealing with globalization requires investing in highly trained skillforce (investing in people) </br>
								- POST 1978 TRANSITION: </br>
								- winners: consumers (products are cheaper), investors/financiers (stock prices going up & deregulated wall street), company brass (increased wages) </br>
								- losers: workers (wages down & workforce reduced) </br>
								- workers w/o unions = no voice = reduction of worker benifiets & wages </br>
								- 3 Crutches to maintain standard of living: Women go into paying work. Borrowing, going into debt (homes turning into ATMs). </br>
								- VICIOUS CYCLE: wages stagnate, workers buy less, companies downsize, tax revenues decrease, government cuts programs, workers are less educated, unemployment rises </br>
								- Money = politicians becomes a puppet </br>
								- Lobyists pay for access, people are absuing wealth to entrench their weath</br>
								- Top marginal tax rate is the exact opposite of the gap increase </br>
								-

								On Friday, Mr.Fitz had us respond to the following question:
								"Has government always played a role in the economy and should government policy
								 specifically help the middle class?" Here is my response: </br>
